# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gather more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop in Hawaii. This will be done by looking at historical weather data for different locations. The primary points of interest from the data are the temperature and precipitation. Temperature and percipitation will have a significant impact on the days the buisness would be able to be open and profitable. Adverse weather would be a deterant to opening the shop in certain areas. Specifically, the request is for temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
  - Average temperatures: June - 74.9 degrees; December - 71 degrees
  - Minimum temperatures: June - 64 degrees; December - 56 degrees.  
  - Maximum temperatures: June - 85 degrees; December -83 degrees.

## Summary
My recommendation would be that this is a good spot, pending percipitation data.
